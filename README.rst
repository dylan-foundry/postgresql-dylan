postgresql
==========

This library wraps `libpq`_.

To do a build, use ``make`` so that the appropriate steps
are executed. Make sure that you have ``pg_config`` on the
``$PATH``.

You will also need a build of ``melange`` from the
`melange`_ repo on your ``$PATH``.

See the TODO for a more complete list of issues to be
addressed.
